# FourWeeksOfCode
I've set myself a challenge to code for at least half an hour every day for four weeks.

Day 0: (JavaScript)A few HOF's mainly using filter, some and map.
  Filter: Returns an array of all elements that return true from the passed function.
  Some: Returns true if at least one element in the array returns true from the passed function.
  Map: Returns an array as a result of applying the passed function to all elements in the initial array.
